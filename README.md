# planarity app

Setting out to create a visualization of the planarity testing algorithm, which I wrote a thesis on in college.

As an intermediary step, I'd like to complete a depth first search visualizer.

Slotting out team each weekend to complete this:
* 1/18 - 1/20 weekend -- going through a basic d3 tutorial as a refresher
* 1/25 - 1/26 weekend -- be able to render k5 in d3
* 2/1 - 2/2 weekend -- be able to render an arbitrary graph in d3
* 2/8 - 2/9 weekend -- visualize a run through of dfs on a graph
